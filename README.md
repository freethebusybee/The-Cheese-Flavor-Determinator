FEATURESðŸ§€
The Cheese Flavor Determinator is an interactive tool designed to help you find the perfect cheese based on your preferences. The Jupyter Notebook provides drop-down menus allowing you to select criteria such as milk type (cow or goat), country of origin, and flavor profile (creamy, nutty, sharp, or tangy). Once you make your selections, the tool displays a list of cheeses that match your criteria along with URLs for more detailed information about each cheese. This user-friendly interface makes it easy to explore a wide variety of cheeses tailored to your tastes.
